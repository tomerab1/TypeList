# Introduction
This is a simple implementation of a type list.
It includes several algorithms for manipulating the list and its elements.
Feel free to contribute more test\algorithm or change the current ones 
to make the implementation more robust and efficient.
I've written for educational purpose while skimming thorugh 'Modern C++ Design' (Andrei Alexandrescu).

# Features

## Reverse
Reverses the list.

## TypeAt
Return the element at the specified index.

## RemoveType
Removes the specified type from the list.

## RemoveAll
Remove all occurrences of the type from the list.

## Replace
Replaces the specified type with the new type specified.

## ReplaceAll
Replace all the occurrences of the specified type with the new type specified.

## RemoveDuplicates
Removes any duplicate from the list.

## CompareList
Compare the two lists passed to it for equality.
